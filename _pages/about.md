My name is Malle Schilling! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Engineering Education at Virginia Tech. My primary research interests lie at the intersection of rural education and engineering education, largely informed by my own experiences as a rural student who pursued engineering. 

If you are interested in collaborating and learning more, please feel free to contact me via [email](schillingmr@vt.edu)!
