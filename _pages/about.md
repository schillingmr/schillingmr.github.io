I am currently working as a Researcher and Evaluator at Virginia Tech. My primary research interests lie at the intersection of rural education and engineering education, largely informed by my own experiences as a rural student who pursued engineering, and community engagement to address wicked problems through collaboration and systems thinking. 

If you are interested in learning more or collaborating, please feel free to contact me!
