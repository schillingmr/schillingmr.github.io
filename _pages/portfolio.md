My research interests and goals are informed by my own experiences as a rural student who pursued engineering, curiosities about the systems and structures of education, and my commitment to building community infrastructure and resilience to support education ecosystems. My approach to research is through a lens of critical pragmatism. I have expertise in various research methodologies including case study, thematic analysis, regression analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and multilevel modeling.
