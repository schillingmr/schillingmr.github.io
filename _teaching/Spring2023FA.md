Research-Practice Partnerships to Address Wicked Problems in Educational Systems was a special topics class offered in the Spring 2023 semester. As a faculty apprentice for this class, I assisted the instructor in identifying readings, contributing to class discussion, and leading class activities and discussions. 

Activity Example
======
The activity linked [here](/files/RPP_activityexample.pdf) walks through a reflection around a wicked problem related to education that students wanted to explore more. This activity is specifically informed by systems thinking research and literature.

Discussion - Emergent Strategy and Partnerships

The lecture from this day specifically connected readings about partnerships and collaboration, as discussed by scholars Gray and Purdy, as well as the book Emergent Strategy by adrienne maree brown.
