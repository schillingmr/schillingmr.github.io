Systems Thinking was an elective course I offered to students attending the Virginia Governor's School for Agriculture during Summer 2022. This elective course engaged students in systems thinking to further their understanding of complex systems in relevant, local contexts. Students developed visualizations of a systems problem they identified and defined, and developed strategies that might address the problem. I encouraged students to explore anything that is of interest to them, ranging from agricultural systems, economic systems, social systems, or technical systems, to name a few. 

Enduring Understandings and Essential Questions
=====
Enduring Understandings: 
Learners will understand thatâ€¦
- there are interconnected systems in their communities they can see, interact with, and describe or visualize.
- systems can be complex but are connected through very important relationships within or between systems.
- they can leverage their own experiences, knowledge, and values in their education.
- they can engage with their communities through both a critical and appreciative lens.

Essential Questions:
- Where do I see systems in my day-to-day?
- How do I identify and define the systems?
- How can I use systems thinking to develop strategies to address problems that are important to me?


Activities and Overall Approach
=====
The activities centered around three stages:
1. **Building a Base:** Students will first engage in activities to build their understanding of systems thinking. They will develop an understanding of systems thinking
2. **Defining a System:** Students will engage in photoelicitation to identify components of systems in their communities that are important to them. Additionally, students will interact with community members and other stakeholders in their community to help them define the problem and the relationships between different components. Community interviews and the utilization of photoelicitation will help students develop a systems map of a problem
3. **Developing Strategies:** Students will develop strategies to address problems in their communities as defined by their systems maps using systems thinking concepts (e.g. leverage points, critical systems heuristics). This step will encourage students to take action and to develop strategies they believe will be impactful in their places.
