* Understanding what it means to teach place-based STEM curriculum
* Determining the role of place-based education in developing understandings of STEM concepts

Research Statement and Relevant Work
======
My interests in place-based education stemmed from interests in other bodies of literature like culturally relevant pedagogy, culturally sustaining pedagogy, rural literacies, and funds of knowledge (to name a few). As such, I want to explore how place-based education is enacted in STEM classrooms and the role place-based education has on shifting conceptions of STEM concepts. I have some experience with developing a place-based curriculum through my involvement in [SEE VT](https://theroanokestar.com/2021/05/07/va-tech-researcher-looks-to-instill-pride-and-hope-for-rural-schoolchildren/).

* Analyzing survey data to determine different levels of conceptions of engineering after engaging with [VT PEERS](https://eng.vt.edu/magazine/stories/spring-2020/discovering-the-rural-engineer.html) programming
  * Conducted exploratory factor analysis using middle school survey data to determine latent factors associated with students conceptions of engineering
  * Publication: Stay tuned!
* Developing a measure to determine levels of middle school students' systems thinking in a place-based heat curriculum implemented in a local school system's summer enrichment programming
  * Created a dyadic interview instrument to spark conversation between students about issues of heat in their communities to provide insight into their systems thinking skills
