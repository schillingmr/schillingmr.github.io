* Exploring rural STEM career pathways
* Supporting rural STEM ecosystems
* Engaging with rural students, teachers, and communities
  
## Research Statement and Relevant Work
My interests in rural education and engineering education are largely informed by own experiences as a rural student seeking an engineering degree. Too often, it seemed like my experiences growing up in a rural place were wildly different from my peers. My experiences are the basis of my dissertation work which has resulted in three manuscripts:

* Developing a conceptual model for what it means to engage with rural students, teachers, and communities as engineering educators
  * Publication: [A Conceptual Model for Engineering Educators in Rural Places: Critical Reflection and Engagement](https://seejournal.org/articles/10.21061/see.97)
* Exploring the individual- and community-level factors that affect enrollment in 4-year and 2-year/community college engineering, engineering technology, and computer science pathways
  * Multilevel modeling using large dataset containing high school and postsecondary enrollment data for students in Virginia
  * Publication: Stay tuned!
* Understanding the supports and barriers rural STEM professionals experienced on their career pathways and the influences on their decisions to stay in, return to, or leave their rural communities to pursue their careers
  * Thematic analysis using data from interviews conducted with rural STEM professionals from Southwest Virginia
  * Publication: Stay tuned!
