* Understanding stakeholder perspectives on change efforts and capacity building

Research Statement and Relevant Work
======
My interests in community engagement stemmed from a need to ensure that research is addressing real-world challenges in partnership with communities. In 2023, I was recognized as an Emerging Engagement Scholar by the Engagement Scholarship Consortium. My perspective as a systems engineering means that working with stakeholders to develop sustainable infrastructure for partnerships is a crucial part of my future vision for the success of my research. Much of the work I have pursued as a graduate student has had elements of community engagement, and I plan to pursue projects that reflect similar goals and values.
